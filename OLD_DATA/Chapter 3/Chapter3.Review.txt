[1] What is a computation?
Computation is the process of a computer working through each line of code expressions it is presented with. This includes calculation, iteration and all other types of operations the computer has been tasked with.
In other words, converting input into output.

[2] What do we mean by inputs and outputs to a computation? Give Examples.
You give the computer an input to, for example, have it put that data into a formula and then calculate output data. This is a computation and as a result the user recieves his processed input data in the form of program output.

[3] What are the three requirements a programmer should keep in mind when expressing computations?
To express computation:
- Correctly
- Simply
- Efficiently

[4] What does an expression do?
An expression computes a value from a number of operands. Any assignment or calculation is an expression.

[5] What is the difference between a statement and an expression, as described in this chapter?
A statement can be used to iterate through expressions, choose between expressions or omit expressions. It doesn't necessarily require an operator.

[6] What is an lvalue? List the operators that require an lvalue. Why do these operators, and not the others, require an lvalue?
Operators such as assignment (lval = x), compund assignment (lval *= x) and increment/decrement (lval++/lval--) require an lvalue, because they all need an object value to write over/into.
Others, such as relational operators (<, >, ==) do not.

[7] What is a constant expression?
A constant value that, after being defined, will never be altered in any way. Use constexpr if you already know what value to assign to a constant during compile-time and const if that value must be defined during run_time.

[8] What is a literal?
A value that is explicitly written (hard-coded) into a program. For example, an int literal would be 12 and a string literal "HelloWorld".

[9] What is a symbolic constant and why do we use them?
It's a named object whose value you can't alter after initialization. They are used to give descriptive names to i.e. universal constants such as Pi, the speed of light or the gravitaional constant of earth.

[10] What is a magic constant? Give examples.
They are literals in code where it's unclear what they are supposed to represent or how their value is derived. Coming across a value such as 299792458 in someone's code would earn the title of magic constant. Do not do this.

[11] What are some operators that we can use for integers and floating-point values?
All assignment operators, along with a lval of the according data type. Also arithmetic operators, as well as relational operators among lots of others.

[12] What operators can be used on integers but not on floating-point numbers?
The modulo/mod operator (%), because it deals with remainders of integer division.

[13] What are some operators that can be used for strings?
The assignment (=) and add-to-end operators (+=), relational operators and input/output operators (>>/<<).

[14] When would a programmer prefer a switch-statement to an if-statement?
If a problem only requires a simple comparison between values of int or char type, a switch-statement is better suited for its solution. More complex tests, such as ones requiring relational operators, would be better suited for if-statements.

[15] What are some common problems with switch-statements?
Should you forget to put a break-statement into each switch case, a fallthrough can happen, which would execute every case instead of just the one intended. Switch-statements also can't compare other data values such as strings.

[16] What is the function of each part of the header line in a for-loop, and in what sequence are they executed?
In first part of the header line you usually define a control variable, which is in charge of how many iterations a loop will go through. It is executed first and only once, regardless of loop iterations.
In the second part a loop condition is declared. Most commonly the control variable is compared to another value, using a relational operator. The condition is checked before every loop iteration,
including the very first right after the control variable is defined. As long as it returns true, the loop will repeat one more time.
The last part is where the control variable gets incremented/decremented. After a number of increments the loop condition should return false. This part is executed after every loop iteration.

[17] When should the for-loop be used and when should the while-loop be used.
A for-loop is more useful when your loop requires more control, and should run a certain number of times. A while loop is more flexible in its loop condition and can be used to i.e. read input until the user is done and the input operation returns false.

[18] Describe what the line char foo(int x) means in a function definition.
The above line can be split into three parts.
The first (char) specifies a return data type. In this case the function foo() will return a value of type char, which can be held onto using an expression such as: char myChar = foo(myInt);.
The second (foo) defines the function with the name "foo". Whenever this function is called, you would use its name to do so.
The third (int x) specifies an argument type as well as its name in the function's scope. Whenever you call foo(), you must also include the argument x, which can be any value of type int.
Within the function body this argument/parameter will always be referred to by its given name x. When calling the function however, you're able to use int variables of any name for passing x.

[19] When should you define a separate function for part of a program? List reasons.
- If you have a chunk of code that is reused several times.
- If a chunk of code has a clear, distinct purpose that is easily isolated.
- If the division makes logical sense in your program's structure.

[20] What can you do to an int that you cannot do to a string?
Perform arithmetic operations (except for addition), perform composite assignment operations (except for addition) and increment/decrement.

[21] What can you do to a string that you cannot do to a string?
Add one string to the end of another (concatenation) using a simple expression(str1 = str1 + str2; str1 += str2).

[22] What is the index of the third element of a vector?
2. If the vector's size() is less than 3, undefined.

[23] How do you write a for-loop that prints every element of a vector?
First you define a control variable to iterate through each element. Then you use the : operator and specify the vector's name after. In the for-loops body you'd have an output expression for each iteration of the control variable.
It would look something like this:
for (int x : vectorName)
	cout << x << '\n';

[24] What does vector<char> alphabet(26); do?
This line of code defines a vector named alphabet to have 26 elements of type char. Since no values for them are given, each element is initialized as '', or an empty char.

[25] Describe what push_back() does to a vector.
It appends a value to the end of a vector, thus increasing its size() by 1. push_back() takes the chosen value as its argument and only accepts it, if it aligns with the vector's element type.
Its use would look something like this:
vectorName.push_back(val);

[26] What does vector's member size() do?
It returns the number of elements a vector is holding as an integer. Optimally this return is used or held onto in some way.
Its use would look something like this:
int vectorSize = vectorName.size();

[27] What makes vector so popular/useful?
It allows you to save and handle large amounts of data at a time. This usefulness scales with the amount of data you're handling.

[28] How do you sort the elements of a vector?
You would use the sort() function from the standart-library. It's an algorithm to sort either numerically or alphabetically, depending on vector element type.
