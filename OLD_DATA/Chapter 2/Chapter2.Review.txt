[1] What is meant by the term prompt?
A prompt is used to let the user know what a program expects from their next input, such as when they need enter their name or age.

[2] What operator do you use to read into a variable
The assignment operator (=) is used to initialize or define variables.

[3] What notations can you use to initialize an object?
When initializing an object, you must first specify a data type with which the initialized data will be interpreted, such as int or char. Then you give it a name so you can later access your reserved memory.
Lastly you use the assignment operator (=) to initialize your object with a value.

[4] If you want the user to input an integer value into your program for a variable named number, what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it and to input the value into your program?
1. cout << "Please enter an integer value: ";
2. cin >> number;

[5] What is '\n' called and what purpose does it serve?
The special character '\n' is called the newline character or an escape sequence and it is used to move the cursor to the beginning of the next line, as if the user has pressed enter.

[6] What terminates input into a string?
The standart input stream (cin) followed by the "get from" operator (>>) again followed by a variable of the string data type. The input terminates when any form of whitespace is entered (spaces, tabs, linebreaks).

[7] What terminates input into an integer?
Again you'd use a cin statement, only this time followed by a variable of the int data type. If any other characters than whole number are entered, the variable won't save them.

[8] How would you write the following as a single line of code: 1. cout << "Hello, ";
																2. cout << first_name;
																3. cout << "!\n";
1. cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";

[9] What is an object?
An object is defined as any type of data, that has been saved in memory or even just a piece of memory that's been reserved for future use.

[10] What is a literal?
A literal or constant is a piece of data that is not used through a variable, but rather written into code directly. The following line includes a string literal and an int literal:

1. cout << "This is a string literal. " << num + 1 << " That was a int variable (num) that was incremented by an int literal (1).";

[11] What kinds of literals are there?
Most types of data can be entered into code as literals, such as: char, string, int, double, float and many more.

[12] What is a variable?
A variable is a named object. This means that every variable has a name, value and an adress in memory. As the term would suggest, the value is changeable, though a variable's name isn't.

[13] What are the typical sizes for a char, an int, and a double?
An object's size in memory is given in byte (8 bits = 1 byte). A char object holds 1 byte, an int 4 bytes, and a double usually holds 8 bytes of memory.

[14] What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such as ints and strings?
Usually one measures in byte, of which one includes 8 bits. A bit is just a piece of information that can either be a 1 or a 0; true or false.

[15] What is the difference between = and ==?
The single equals sign (=) is used for the purpose of assigning values to variables. The double equals sign (==) is used for comparing two values, to check whether they are equal; also known as a relational operator.

[16] What is a definiton?
A definition is a statement that gives name and values to an object, and then reserves some memory according to the object's data type.

[17] What is an initialization and how does it differ from an assignment?
Through initialization one first reserves a variable's memory and first declares its name and value. Assignment is how one changes an initialzed variable's value.

[18] What is string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++?
String concatenation is the process of binding two separate strings together to form a new string. C++ makes this easier than most programming languages because in it, it can be done simply with the string add-to-end operator (+=).

[19] What operators can you apply to an int?
Arithmetic operators (such as: +, -, *, /, %, etc.), relational operators (such as: <, >, <=, >=, ==, etc.) and composite assignment operators (such as: ++, --, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.), among too many others to list them all.

[20] Which of the following are legal names in C++? If a name is not legal, why not?
This_little_pig; legal
This_1_is fine; illegal; space not allowed
2_For_1_special; illegal; names mustn't begin with numbers
latest thing; illegal; space not allowed
George@home; illegal; '@' not allowed
_this_is_ok; illegal; names mustn't begin with underscores
MineMineMine; legal
number; legal
correct?; illegal; '?' not allowed
stroustrup.com; illegal; '.' not allowed
$PATH; legal

[21] Give five examples of legal names that you shouldn't use because they are likely to cause confusion.
1. NOT_A_CONSTANT
2. _might_overwrite
3. vcvn; very confusing variable name
4. X
5. int_404

[22] What are some good rules for choosing names?
- choose descriptive names
- name your variables in a way so they can't be confused with the integrated variables of your compiler/IDE
- stick to a naming system that makes it very clear whether a name belongs to a variable, constant or function (etc.)

[23] What is type safety and why is it important?
A program is type safe when no object is converted in an unsafe manner. For example don't assign a variable of type double to a variable of int, because information will be lost.
Also don't be so silly and try to use arithmetic operations with a char variable.

[24] Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing?
Because when a decimal number is converted to a whole number, any information beyond the decimal point will be lost. This is known as narrowing and it can cause a lot of annoyances, especially in larger projects.

[25] Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type is safe or unsafe.
A type conversion is only safe when both data types have either an equal amount of reserved memory, or the type that is converted into has a larger amount of available memory (widening).
If the type you are converting from is larger than the one you convert into, you risk losing information (narrowing).

[26] How can we avoid undesirable conversions?
Only convert a data type into another, when you can be sure that their memory size is either equal or you're converting from a smaller into a larger container.

[27] What are the uses of auto?
Using auto gets rid of the redundancy of specifying a data type, when it is obvious that you're storing for example a char 'x'. Instead of typing:
	char myChar = 'c';
	
you could just type:
	auto myChar = 'c';
	
and your compiler would do the rest. However this could cause some confusion when a variable is initialized into an unexpected type or you just lose track of what it's supposed to be yourself.
For the current stage of learning the basics, auto isn't that useful anyways and you should refrain from using it until later.
